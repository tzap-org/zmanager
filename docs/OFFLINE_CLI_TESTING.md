# Offline CLI parity validation

Validated on 3 October 2026 against the workspace based on `7dec715`, with
Rust 1.95.0. Windows' existing offline workflow is now exercised on Unix too.
These results cover macOS ARM64 and Linux ARM64 in Docker; they do not constitute
a new Windows run or x86_64 validation.

## Results

| Check | macOS ARM64 | Linux ARM64 / Debian Bookworm Docker |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `cargo test --workspace` | 2,261 passed, 2 existing ignored | 2,144 passed, 2 existing ignored, as an unprivileged user |
| Additional Unix terminal integration tests | 2 passed | Included in the workspace run |
| `cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets` | Passed without warnings | Passed without warnings |
| `cargo check --workspace --all-targets` | Passed without warnings | Passed without warnings |
| `cargo fmt --check` | Passed | Passed |
| `bash scripts/verify-artifact-profiles.sh` | Passed | Passed |
| `cargo run -p zmanager-cli -- healthcheck` | Ready | Ready |
| Sudo consent, cancellation, unattended modes | Passed | Passed |
| Actual sudo password authentication and encrypted extraction | Not exercised with a macOS system password | Passed as a disposable non-root user |

The workspace runs include hostile archive, extraction, cancellation, metadata,
format interoperability, CLI help, shell completion, and FFI tests. Linux also
passed a root-run workspace suite before the final normal-user run. After
tightening the key-generation test to fail instead of silently returning on
error, the affected CLI suites passed again: 224 tests on macOS and 223 on
Linux. The final format, clippy and check gates passed without warnings.

## Offline workflow coverage

`crates/zmanager-cli/tests/offline_tzap_cli.rs` now runs on every platform and
contains ten tests. It provisions only local TEST certificates, with no hosted
login or network service:

- Document signing and verification, explicit custom trust, tamper rejection.
- Contact key generation, signed export/import, rejection of altered cards,
  listing and removal.
- Sharing to two recipients, extraction and listing using each recipient key,
  exact bytes through `--to-stdout`, spaces and Unicode in paths.
- Overwrite refusal, forced replacement, rejection of removed contacts while
  preserving the existing archive.
- Fresh-install certificate discovery and guidance, invalid account paths,
  certificate discovery without private keys.
- Malformed documents, envelopes and cards, missing signing identities and
  unknown recipients, without creating output on failure.

Fixtures retain the recipient private keys in test memory. The CLI imports the
fixture identity into its native secret store, so macOS need not authorize a
second executable to read keys created by the CLI. Cleanup deletes only the
fixture's random secret references.

Certificate discovery reads the public catalogue directly. It no longer
resolves private keys or requires Keychain authorization merely to list
certificates. Legacy file inventories remain supported.

The completion contract uses the executable built by Cargo and disables shell
startup files. An older Full `zm` installed on PATH no longer changes offline
completion expectations.

## Unix sudo behavior and terminal tests

Before extraction writes files, the CLI checks write/search permission on the
destination or its nearest existing ancestor. A protected destination offers
`Retry extraction with sudo? [y/N]` in an interactive terminal. Sudo handles
system authentication directly; the CLI never reads the system password.
The retry preserves the original argument vector and working directory, and
an already elevated process cannot offer another retry. Files may be owned by
root. Archive password prompts remain separate.

Redirected input/output, JSON, quiet mode, `--password-stdin`, and
`--no-password-prompt` do not offer sudo. Permission problems discovered after
extraction has started are reported by the engine; there is no automatic retry
of partially completed extraction. This preflight concerns destination access,
not privileged metadata restoration or permission failures in other commands.

Run the disposable terminal harness as a normal user:

```sh
python3 scripts/test-unix-elevation.py target/debug/zm
```

The two Rust tests in `unix_elevation_cli.rs` run this harness automatically when
Python is available and reject invocation of the internal retry by an
unprivileged process. A root-run suite cannot exercise a normal user's access
denial, so run it as a non-root user too.

For the Linux password test, create a disposable Docker user with sudo access
and set `ZMANAGER_TEST_SUDO_PASSWORD` in that container's process environment to
its fixture password. Never supply a real user's password. The same harness
then checks actual authentication, Unicode/spaced arguments, preservation of
`--overwrite never`, and a separate archive password prompt without either
password being echoed. It removes its privileged fixture outputs afterward.

Linux native identity tests require an unlocked Secret Service keyring. Use a
UTF-8 locale for external archive-tool tests:

```sh
export LANG=C.UTF-8 LC_ALL=C.UTF-8
dbus-run-session -- bash -c '
  printf "\n" | gnome-keyring-daemon --unlock --components=secrets >/dev/null
  cargo test --workspace
'
```

The validation container used `rust:1.95-bookworm`, separate Cargo/target volumes,
and read-only mounts for the `tzap`, `localsend-rs`, and `forensic-vfs-engine`
siblings. Installing native build tools, archive test oracles, D-Bus and
GNOME Keyring matches the dependencies listed in `.github/workflows/ci.yml`.
